# Hangman

**Hangman** is a guessing Game for one player with Responsive Web Design, created with HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript using jQuery & Media Queries.  

## About the game:
* The player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses.
* The word to guess is a noun. Proper nouns, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. 
* Each letter of the word is represented by box with a star. 
* If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the letter shows in all its correct positions. Suggesting letter which does not occur in the word draws one element of a hanged man.
